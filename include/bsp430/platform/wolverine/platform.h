 * @brief Platform-specific include for MSP430FR5969 in a TS430RGZ48C carrier.
 *
 * This board is also known as the "Fraunchpad"
 *
 * The following platform-specific features are supported: <ul>
 *
 * <li> #BSP430_PERIPH_EXPOSED_CLOCKS Clocks share LED lines, and can
 * be measured at the test points below the LEDs.  Proceeding from the
 * rightmost LED: TP10 provides SMCLK, TP11 provides MCLK, and TP12
 * provides ACLK.
 *
 * </ul>
